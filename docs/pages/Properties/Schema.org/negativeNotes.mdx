# negativeNotes

Provides negative considerations regarding something, most typically in pro/con lists for reviews (alongside <a class="localLink" href="/positiveNotes">positiveNotes</a>). For symmetry <br/><br/>

In the case of a <a class="localLink" href="/Review">Review</a>, the property describes the <a class="localLink" href="/itemReviewed">itemReviewed</a> from the perspective of the review; in the case of a <a class="localLink" href="/Product">Product</a>, the product itself is being described. Since product descriptions 
tend to emphasise positive claims, it may be relatively unusual to find <a class="localLink" href="/negativeNotes">negativeNotes</a> used in this way. Nevertheless for the sake of symmetry, <a class="localLink" href="/negativeNotes">negativeNotes</a> can be used on <a class="localLink" href="/Product">Product</a>.<br/><br/>

The property values can be expressed either as unstructured text (repeated as necessary), or if ordered, as a list (in which case the most negative is at the beginning of the list).
