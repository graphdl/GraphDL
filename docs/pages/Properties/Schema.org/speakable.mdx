# speakable

Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech.<br/><br/>

The <em>speakable</em> property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values:<br/><br/>

1.) <em>id-value</em> URL references - uses <em>id-value</em> of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of <em>speakable</em> has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.<br/><br/>

2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, e.g. via class attribute. Use the <Link href="/cssSelector">cssSelector</Link> property.<br/><br/>

3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the <a class="localLink" href="/xpath">xpath</a> property.<br/><br/>

For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this
we define a supporting type, <a class="localLink" href="/SpeakableSpecification">SpeakableSpecification</a>  which is defined to be a possible value of the <em>speakable</em> property.
